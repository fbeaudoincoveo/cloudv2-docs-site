A cloud service that records user interactions with search interfaces and other web content allowing administrators to monitor and measure the Coveo solution usage (see [Coveo Cloud Usage Analytics](http://www.coveo.com/go?dest=cloudhelp&lcid=9&context=89)). 

Adminsitrators can consult and create reports from the Coveo Cloud administration console to visualise usage analytics data (see [Usage Analytics Reports](http://www.coveo.com/go?dest=cloudhelp&lcid=9&context=238)). The usage analytics data also feeds [Coveo Machine Learning](coveo-maching-learning.md) models that are learning user behavior to suggest more relevant content.
