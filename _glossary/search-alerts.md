A Coveo cloud service allowing users to subscribe to search queries or search results and receive email notifications when the followed queries or results change (see [Search Alerts](http://www.coveo.com/go?dest=cloudhelp&lcid=9&context=247)). 

[Coveo Cloud V1](/glossary/coveo-cloud-v1) and [Coveo Cloud V2](/glossary/coveo-cloud-v2) share the search alerts service. The Coveo JavaScript Search Framework comes with components allowing administrators to easily add support for search alerts in search interfaces (see [Coveo Compon ent SearchAlerts](https://coveo.github.io/search-ui/components/searchalerts.html)).
