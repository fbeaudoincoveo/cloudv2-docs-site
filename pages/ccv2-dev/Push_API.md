# Push API

The Push API exposes services which allow you to *push* [items](Glossary_37585054.html#Glossary-Item) and security identities into a [source](Glossary_37585054.html#Glossary-Sou), rather than *pulling* content using "standard" Coveo crawlers.

There currently is no graphical user interface sitting on top of the Push API, so you need to perform your own HTTP calls when you want to use its services.
