# Coveo Cloud V2 Indexing Pipeline Mappings

> The Coveo Cloud V2 indexing pipeline mapping feature is available in beta version (January 7 2017 introduction).

Each Coveo Cloud V2 organization includes an indexing pipeline with various stages to process your system items and make them searchable.

A mapping is an indexing pipeline postconversion stage that you can use to populate fields associated with a source with appropriate values for each source item (see [Fields - Page](http://www.coveo.com/go?dest=cloudhelp&lcid=9&context=287)). When a crawled or pushed item gets to the mapping stage of your Coveo Cloud V2 indexing pipeline, the Document Processing Manager (DPM) adds the mapping rules that are applied to the item.

Note:

> You can manage mapping rules from the Coveo Cloud V2 administration console **Mapping tab** of the source (see [Mapping - Tab](http://www.coveo.com/go?dest=cloudhelp&lcid=9&context=284)).

#### What's Next

Get familiar with the indexing pipeline mapping concepts (see [Indexing Pipeline Mapping Concepts](https://developers.coveo.com/x/YwwvAg)).
