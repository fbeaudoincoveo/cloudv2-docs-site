# Activity API

The Activity API exposes services which allow you to retrieve activity events logged into a [Coveo Cloud V2 organization](Glossary_37585054.html#Glossary-CoveoCloudV2Organization).

In the [Coveo Cloud V2 administration console](Glossary_37585054.html#Glossary-CoveoCloudV2AdministrationConsole), the **Activity Browser** page uses the Activity API extensively (see [Activity Browser - Page](http://www.coveo.com/go?dest=cloudhelp&lcid=9&context=299)).
