# Platform API

The Platform API exposes services which allow you to create and manage aÂ [Coveo Cloud V2 organization](Glossary_37585054.html#Glossary-CoveoCloudV2Organization), and retrieve its corresponding limits, licence, and login activity information.

In the [Coveo Cloud V2 administration console](Glossary_37585054.html#Glossary-CoveoCloudV2AdministrationConsole), the **Settings** panel uses the Platform API extensively (see [Settings - Panel](http://www.coveo.com/go?dest=cloudhelp&lcid=9&context=303)).
